## üîß LSP

- nvim-lspconfig: LSP configuration
- mason.nvim: LSP/DAP/formatter installer (:Mason to open UI)
- mason-lspconfig.nvim: Bridge between Mason and native LSP
- maxon-tool-installer.nvim: Install LSP servers, formatters, and debuggers

### nvim-lspconfig

Responsible for configuring and launching LSP servers.

- Maintained by the official Neovim team.
- Provides easy lspconfig.<server>.setup() APIs to configure each LSP server manually.

### mason.nvim

A package manager for LSP servers, formatters, and debuggers.

- Provides a GUI (:Mason) to install tools like lua-language-server, prettier, debugpy, etc.
- Installs tools but does not automatically configure them with lspconfig.

### mason-lspconfig.nvim

Bridges mason.nvim and nvim-lspconfig.

- Automatically connects installed LSP servers from Mason to lspconfig.
- Handles server name mapping and calls lspconfig[server].setup() for you.
- Supports both ensure_installed and automatic_installation.

### mason-tool-installer.nvim

Automatically installs a list of desired tools via Mason.

- Helps manage and install LSPs, formatters, linters, and DAPs in one place.
- You define a list via ensure_installed = { "lua_ls", "stylua", "prettier", ... }.
- Ensures all required tools are installed on startup.

### How they work together

1. You define which tools and LSPs to install in mason-tool-installer.
2. mason.nvim installs those tools behind the scenes.
3. mason-lspconfig.nvim connects the installed LSPs to nvim-lspconfig.
4. nvim-lspconfig applies your custom configuration to each LSP server.

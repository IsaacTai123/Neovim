### Circular Dependency Issue with Telescope

üìå Note:

Avoid requiring the entire `core.plugin_config` folder in init.lua (e.g., `require("core.plugin_config")`).
Doing so will immediately execute all plugin config files‚Äîincluding Telescope's config‚Äî
even before Lazy.nvim has loaded the plugin.

This caused a circular dependency issue where:

1. `init.lua` eagerly loads `core.plugin_config`, which includes `telescope.lua`
2. `telescope.lua` tries to call `require("telescope")` and configure it
3. At the same time, Lazy.nvim is also preparing to lazy-load `telescope.nvim`
4. This results in both sides trying to load `telescope.nvim` simultaneously,
   leading to a "loop or previous error loading module" message

‚úÖ Solution:

- Do NOT require `core.plugin_config` in `init.lua`
- Instead, in `core.plugins.lua`, use Lazy's `config = function()` to load plugin config individually
  when the plugin is actually initialized.

Example:

```lua
{
  "nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim",
  dependencies = {
    "nvim-lua/plenary.nvim",
    { "nvim-telescope/telescope-fzf-native.nvim", build = "make", cond = function() return vim.fn.executable("make") == 1 end },
    "nvim-telescope/telescope-ui-select.nvim",
  },
  config = function()
    local ok, err = pcall(require, "core.plugin_config.telescope")
    if not ok then
      vim.notify("Failed to load telescope config: " .. err, vim.log.levels.ERROR)
    end
  end,
}
```
